This repository aims to centralize the projects that are done throughout the Computer Science degree at Unisinos.
The projects whose names are dates were carried out in the face-to-face classes.

## Algoritmos e Programação: Fundamentos

This class is an introduction to programming.

The class started with Python and soon moved to Java.
Python was used for explaining the basics of programming, such as types, logic, loops, and Java was used for explaining OOP.

As I already had quite some experience with OOP (using C#) when I started this class, I could already apply some relatively advanced concepts from the beginning.
